          The Department of Computer <span>Science – University</span> of Ghana currently 
          runs Masters of Science (MSc.) in Computer Science and Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) 
          in Computer Science.<br />The MSc. is a 1-year (weekend/evening) programme with a 
          capstone project while the MPhil is a 2-year <span>(full-time)</span> programme. 
          The first year of the MPhil is taught course and second year is research and dissertation. 
          Both programmes are accelerated <span>master’s</span> programme specially designed to train 
          current and future computer scientist who are available for <span>full-time</span> or 
          <span>part-time</span> study.<br /> Students enrolled in these programmes are equipped with 
          broader knowledge in theoretical computer science and advance technical skills to approach 
          science in technology as a disruptive force to manage complex problems of the global society. 
          At the end of these programmes, students will gain hands-on experience in solving complex, and 
          unstructured scientific problems while learning subjects like Advance Databases, Advance Data 
          Structures and Algorithms and Networks
